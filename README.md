# GuruKosh

## Overview

This project provides a tool for parsing publicly GuruKosh text into a structured JSON format. It reads files containing Gurmukhi text and extracts words, meanings, examples, and other facets into an easily readable and manageable JSON structure. This can be particularly useful for linguistic analysis, educational purposes, or digital humanities projects focusing on the Punjabi language.

## Features

- Parses Gurmukhi text line-by-line to extract meaningful data.
- Generates a JSON file for each text file processed, containing structured information.
- Supports batch processing of multiple files.
- Implements modern JavaScript features for efficient and readable code.
